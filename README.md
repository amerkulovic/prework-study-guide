# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  My main motivation was to create a webpage that can provide bootcamp students with a study guide on the important notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  I built this project, so students had an easier time recognizing the important notes about the prework. It was also built to show my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so far into this course.
- What problem does it solve?
  This problem helps students who are lost within the prework and can be referenced as a guide.
- What did you learn?
  I learned how to stylize the website with CSS and how to strucutre the webpage using HTML and add functionality with JS.
